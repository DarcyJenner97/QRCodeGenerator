# QRCodeGenerator

## Purpose
This generator is something I created with the intention of teting how QR Code Generators work. 

## Current State
At current, this is only the initial development, with the capability to generate the QR Codes from text. It has a primary focus on URLs, that can then be downloaded as a picture file to the local device, and have file names mirroring the URL path. 

## Future State
The future development of this project will have the ability to;
 > Customize both the black and the white colours of the QR code

> Change whether the QR code encode in Binary or ASCII

> Change the amount of redundancy in the QR code

> Add logos to the QR code

## Future Development
Currently this project using another JS library to generate the QR Codes. The plan for the future is to redesign the application from the ground up to custom generate the QR codes, to allow for more customisability, and to easier implement the future changes
